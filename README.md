# Project Details - Brief
Turners Car AI car detection system 
The digital team at Turners would like to prototype a solution that allows a user to upload the picture of a car, and then find a similar car in their stock to recommend to customer. Build an application (either runs on your laptop or on the cloud) that can recognise motor vehicles (even better if it recognises certain types of vehicles, e.g. sedan vs hatchback) using a cloud-based AI service on Microsoft Azure.

## Technologies used
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Postman
- React
- MongoDB
- Microsoft Azure ComputerVision REST API
- Node JS
- Express JS

### To Run
- Fork the repo and clone to your code editor
- npm i both the front and backend to install all relevant packages
- npm run dev on both the front and backend directorys.
- To test, upload a JPG or PNG file to the drop zone area and relevant cars detected by AI API will be returned from the DB.
- Note: Microsofts API is not entirely accurate so there may be some discrepancies.
